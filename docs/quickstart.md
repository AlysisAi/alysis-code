# Quickstart

This guide gets Alysis Code installed, configured, and running against a local workspace.

## Install

Alysis Code requires Python 3.11 or newer. The recommended install path is `pipx`:

```bash
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install alysis-code
```

If your default Python is older than 3.11, point `pipx` at a newer interpreter:

```bash
pipx install --python python3.12 alysis-code
```

Virtual-environment installs also work:

```bash
python -m pip install alysis-code
```

## First Run

Start Alysis Code from the project you want to inspect or edit:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
alysis
```

On a fresh install, setup starts with **Connection Method** and asks:
**How would you like to connect Alysis Code to AI models?**

- **Use an API key** continues through provider, API key, default model,
  optional router model, workspace, and sandbox setup. Leave the router model
  unset to inherit the default, or choose a smaller/cheaper model for
  lightweight request routing.
- **Use an AI subscription** opens a second screen of supported provider
  connections, then asks for the workspace and skips API-key setup. The adapter
  owns provider sign-in; Alysis Code keeps its native agent loop, tools, and TUI.
  After sign-in, choose the model and reasoning effort in `/config`.

Setup does not ask for main-agent, task, or subagent step budgets. Execution is
autonomous by default and continues until completion; explicit step or
wall-clock limits are optional advanced safeguards.

The Alysis Code-hosted account option also remains under **Use an API key** and
uses its own sign-in instead of requiring a third-party provider key.

Re-run setup anytime:

```bash
alysis setup
```

After choosing **Use an AI subscription**, the built-in connection currently
supports ChatGPT Codex account sign-in. Connect and select it directly with:

```bash
alysis auth login openai-codex
```

Use `alysis auth login openai-codex --device-code` when a browser callback is
not practical. Alysis Code stores refreshable credentials in its encrypted
provider vault and keeps tokens out of `config.json`. Choose the account model
and its supported reasoning effort together in `/config → Default Model`. Inside
the TUI, `/login` presents both the Alysis Code account and AI subscription choices.

When the selected subscription is disconnected, `alysis` still opens the
native TUI. Its landing page shows one model-access prompt: use `/login` to choose
Alysis Code or an AI subscription, or `/config` for API-key setup. Account
management is also available under `/config → Model Access`. Model prompts stay blocked until
the connection succeeds. Alysis Code then returns to the TUI and opens Default
Model for the paired model/reasoning selection. One-shot `alysis run` calls
fail fast while the subscription is unavailable.

For manual configuration:

```bash
export ALYSIS_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
alysis config set base_url "https://api.openai.com/v1"
alysis config set model "gpt-4.1-mini"
```

To avoid storing a key, pass it for one command:

```bash
alysis run --api-key-stdin "Explain this repository."
```

To switch providers with a different environment variable:

```bash
export OTHER_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
alysis run --api-key-env OTHER_API_KEY --base-url "https://example.com/v1" --model "your-model" "Hello"
```

Those manual examples configure API-key model access. See
[AI subscription connections](account-runtimes.md) for subscription setup,
account status/logout commands, execution-mode mappings, and extension limits.

## Run And Chat

Use `run` for one-shot work:

```bash
alysis run --mode readonly "Explain this repository and identify the main entrypoints."
alysis run --mode review "Fix the failing test and show me the diff."
```

`alysis run` is a bounded one-shot flow. It includes guardrails for execution-style prompts, but
it is still best for focused tasks that can be completed from one instruction. For exploratory or
multi-step work, prefer `alysis chat` or Forge.

Use `chat` for an interactive session:

```bash
alysis chat
```

Useful chat commands:

- `/help`: show commands
- `/status`: show mode, workspace, and active model
- `/pwd`: show workspace root, focus directory, and active workdir
- `/mode`: inspect or change execution mode
- `/config`: open the inline configuration menu, including router model and limits
- `/forge`: start the plan-driven workflow for larger tasks

The same Alysis Code slash-command and tool surface remains available with a
subscription-backed profile. `/model` cannot change a subscription model by
itself; use `/config → Default Model` so model and reasoning effort remain a
compatible persisted pair.

## Workspace Binding

`alysis run` and `alysis chat` bind a workspace before the session starts. The requested path is
the current directory or `--path`. Inside a Git repository, Alysis Code binds to the repository root
and keeps the starting subdirectory as the focus directory.

Missing paths require `--create-path`. Broad paths such as `~` require an explicit override, and `/`
is blocked as a workspace root.

In chat, relative file/search/shell paths default to the active workdir. You can move within the
bound workspace with natural-language requests, `/cd`, or tool calls. Alysis Code does not rebind to a
different workspace mid-session.

## Sandbox Setup

Alysis Code can run shell and verification commands through Docker or Bubblewrap. For the simplest
first run on macOS or Windows, install Docker Desktop first, then run:

```bash
alysis sandbox setup
alysis sandbox doctor --smoke
alysis sandbox pull
```

See [Shell sandbox](shell_sandbox.md) for backend selection, production image pinning, and troubleshooting.

## Images And Tools

For multimodal-compatible models or providers:

```bash
alysis run --image ./screenshot.png "Describe this screenshot."
```

Inspect the built-in tool surface:

```bash
alysis tools
```

Web search is model-selected and model-independent once a backend is configured. For example,
DeepSeek can call the shared Tavily tool even though DeepSeek does not expose a provider-hosted
search API:

```bash
alysis config set web_search_policy auto
alysis config set web_search_mode external
alysis config set web_search_adapter tavily
export ALYSIS_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY=<tavily-key>
alysis tools
```

`web_search_policy=auto` exposes the tool and lets the active model decide when current or
source-backed evidence is needed. `off` hides the tool. Use `/config` to change access and backend
mode interactively. `TAVILY_API_KEY` remains supported as a vendor-specific alias. See
[Web Search](web-search.md) for the provider-hosted coverage matrix and external fallback setup.

Inspect custom tools discovered for the current workspace:

```bash
alysis tool list --path .
```

## Updates

Alysis Code checks for newer releases in the background at most once per configured interval, then
shows cached notices in home/status surfaces. It never installs updates silently. When a newer
release is known, interactive launches also show a one-time popup before the setup and workspace
screens offering to update now, remind you later (24-hour snooze), or skip that version; disable it
with `alysis config set update_prompt_enabled false` or `ALYSIS_UPDATE_PROMPT_ENABLED=0`. To
check PyPI for the latest package immediately:

```bash
alysis update check
```

To apply an available update, run:

```bash
alysis update
```

The command detects common `pipx`, `uv`, virtualenv, and pip installs, shows the exact upgrade
command, and asks before running it. Source or editable installs are left manual.

## Next Steps

- [Credentials](credentials.md): API key precedence and persisted credentials.
- [AI subscription connections](account-runtimes.md): use provider sign-in with Alysis Code's native agent and paired `/config` model/effort selection.
- [Execution modes](../README.md#execution-modes): readonly, review, auto, and fullaccess.
- [Forge](forge.md): plan, execute, verify, and review larger tasks.
- [MCP](mcp.md): connect external MCP servers.
- [Skills](skills.md): install and use reusable instruction bundles.
