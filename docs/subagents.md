# Subagents

## Subagents (Non-Swarm)

Subagents are optional focused helper agents that run as nested sessions from normal
`alysis run` / `alysis chat` (non-swarm) flows. Their model context, messages, and tool loop
are isolated from the parent transcript. The default `workspace_view=shared` uses the parent's
working tree; `workspace_view=isolated` uses a retained Git worktree.

Forge execution and swarm workers currently do not expose subagents. Use subagents during
top-level exploration or planning, then execute scoped Forge tasks directly.

### Current orchestration capabilities

The parent can run one child synchronously or keep working while background children move through
queued, waiting, running, and terminal states. Independent shared-readonly and isolated calls can
run in parallel; isolated writers leave retained candidates for explicit apply or discard, and a
read-only child can verify the exact pinned candidate first. Parents can steer live children,
chain dependent runs, inspect or resume terminal work, and delegate external dependency research
to the evidence-gated `dependency-scout`. Write-capable children may use a bounded set of
non-editing helpers without opening recursive delegation.

Default behavior is ON for top-level chat/run sessions. Use `--no-subagents` or
`alysis config set subagents_enabled false` to disable it.

The parent is guided to work directly by default and choose a subagent when its
contribution justifies the extra context, coordination and latency. It can make
that choice autonomously without an explicit user request. Explicit requests to
delegate remain valid, and waiting for a useful child's result is appropriate
when the parent reaches a real dependency. This preference applies to all prompt
densities in both chat and one-shot sessions; it adds no spawn gate, permission
step or model-specific quota.

Subagents receive family-specific working guidance plus their role instructions.
The shared configuration and parent prompt profiles are described in
[Agent system prompts](agent_prompts.md).

Enable/disable options:

- config: `alysis config set subagents_enabled true|false`
- per command: `alysis run --subagents ...` / `alysis run --no-subagents ...`
- per command: `alysis chat --subagents` / `alysis chat --no-subagents`

UX behavior in chat:

- Toolbar includes `subagents=on|off` so the current state is always visible.
- Users can describe the outcome in normal chat; they do not need to select a subagent or name an internal tool. The repository agent loop receives a capability catalog and the model chooses whether an available specialist is useful.
- `/subagents` is the only subagent chat command. It opens a picker containing currently active
  children, shows each child's state and activity, and selects one into the existing live pane.
  When none are active it prints `no active subagents`. The command is read-only and works while
  the parent turn is running.
- In the TUI each subagent is identified by its name plus an activity tagline (e.g.
  `debugger · hunting the root cause`) in the spawn line, live status, and result attribution.
  Agents wear no per-agent symbol. Custom subagents get a stable name-derived accent colour and
  fall back to their description.
- While subagents run, the TUI footer shows one count badge such as `↪ 3 subagents` rather than
  one badge per child. It clears when the final child ends or the parent is interrupted. Elapsed
  activity time is measured from each child's own start, independently of the parent session's age.
- With trace set to `compact` or `full`, subagent runs stream nested live tool progress under the parent session instead of staying silent until completion.

Request parallel independent work through normal chat, for example:

```text
Use three read-only subagents in one parallel batch: map the architecture, inspect the tests,
and review concurrency risks. Wait for all three, verify their key claims, and synthesize one
answer. Do not edit files.
```

The calls must be emitted together in one assistant response. The host runs at most four eligible
children concurrently and returns results in call order, even when children finish out of order.
Eligibility is based on workspace safety, not merely whether the child can run commands:

| Workspace view | Role contract | Same-response scheduling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| isolated | any effective mode | parallel |
| shared | effective mode is exact `readonly` | parallel |
| shared | `allow_workspace_writes: false` and `parallel_nonwriting_shared=true` | parallel |
| shared | write-capable, or non-writing without the opt-in | sequential |

Eligible calls may be mixed in one parallel batch. An ineligible call no longer serializes its
siblings: if at least two calls are eligible, that subset runs first (up to four at once), then the
remainder runs one at a time. With fewer than two eligible calls, the batch stays fully sequential.
Mixed subagent/non-subagent responses, user opt-out, tool hooks, and deadline admission retain their
all-or-nothing safety gates. Whenever two or more requested subagents are not fully concurrent, the
surface prints one line naming the deferred roles and reason, and the session records a
`subagent_batch_serialized` event.

Shared non-writing command-capable roles such as `debugger` and `verifier` are default-off for
parallel execution because a shell command can still mutate the shared tree. Enable the explicit
opt-in with:

```text
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.parallel_nonwriting_shared true
```

The host still checks material workspace changes after each non-writing run. If an opted-in shared
child mutates the tree, the entire batch fails, names the offending run and paths, and does not start
the deferred remainder. Write-capable shared roles remain sequential; use `workspace_view=isolated`
to run them concurrently. Every isolated writer receives a separate worktree.

### Background children

Top-level chat and one-shot sessions can start independent work and continue while it runs:

- `subagent_spawn` starts a child and immediately returns its `run_id` and state.
- `subagent_send` queues parent guidance for delivery before the child's next model step.
- `subagent_status` reports one child or all children without joining them.
- `subagent_wait` joins one child or all children. An optional timeout returns the completed
  subset plus `pending_run_ids`, so the parent can continue and wait again later.
- `subagent_cancel` cancels one child or all children. A queued child is cancelled without ever
  launching a nested session. Its result separates runs that actually transitioned under
  `cancelled_run_ids` from `already_finished_run_ids` and `unknown_run_ids`.
- `subagent_resume` continues a terminal child's retained conversation as a new linked background
  run. Successful or degraded children require a nonempty follow-up task; failed, incomplete, or cancelled
  work can resume with its original task or a revised brief.

Use background spawning only when the investigation is independent of the parent's next decision.
Use synchronous `subagent_run` when the result is needed immediately. Both paths return a stable
run ID for inspection and follow-up.

Completed background reports are delivered automatically at a safe parent model boundary as
bounded, screened, untrusted evidence. Delivery joins that result; `subagent_wait` can still retrieve
the full report. Completion status describes the child's execution, not verified correctness or
integration. The parent continues independent work and uses focused evidence to assess the result.
Internal exit cleanup and cancellation preserve undelivered report evidence. Ready reports are
recorded before acknowledgement even when the current turn cannot make another model call, so
the next interactive turn or saved-session history can use them.

Process exit status alone is not a completion signal. Existing budget policy returns exit zero for
some graceful stops, including exhausted empty-response recovery. Such stops retain their structured
stop reason and degraded/internal-fallback status; runtime fallback summaries do not qualify as a
successful child deliverable.

Synchronous and background children share one parent-session run-ID namespace. Status, live-pane
inspection, and resume resolve either kind identically, including a retained synchronous run that stopped
incomplete. An isolated child's capture precedes its terminal event, so that event reflects an
incomplete capture or a proven no-change result.

An immediate child follows `spawned -> queued (if full) -> running -> joined|cancelled`. A chained
child follows `spawned -> waiting -> queued -> running -> joined|cancelled`. The background cap
defaults to 3, queue release is FIFO, and the same-response batch cap remains 4.

Shared-view background children must resolve to exact `readonly`. An isolated background child may
use any post-clamp mode because it owns a separate worktree. Children cannot spawn nested children,
and Forge execution and swarm workers do not receive the background tools.

A parent turn never completes with an unjoined child. When the model tries to finalize early, the
host sends at most two corrective messages asking it to wait or cancel. If it still finalizes,
`subagent_orchestration.turn_end_policy` decides the outcome:

- `wait` (default): the host joins every child, injects the collected results, and allows one final
  model response.
- `cancel`: the host cancels every child and appends a cancellation notice to the final response.

User interruption cancels running and queued background children. The TUI remains responsive and
may queue the next prompt, but it does not start that prompt or rebuild Permissions until the
retiring turn has released its session ownership. Exiting the TUI likewise waits for that unwind,
so temporary narrower Permissions cannot be restored underneath a still-running turn. The footer's
cancellation timer starts when interruption is requested rather than reusing the age of the turn or
active child. Durable logs record `cancellation_requested` before `turn_interrupted`, which separates
request-to-unwind latency from total turn duration. Usage records are replayed incrementally while a
child runs and once more at join, with a per-child cursor preventing double counting in `/usage` and
the HUD.

Joining an isolated child does not discard its candidate. Unapplied results are retained across
turns and remain available through the coordinator status and apply/discard tools. They are not
re-advertised as synthetic user instructions on later model calls. The terminal `final` event keeps
the complete assistant report and appends any retained-workspace notice, so event-only consumers do
not lose the report. Closing the parent session releases ordinary remaining candidates and records
a cleanup summary. Incomplete captures and candidates containing ignored output remain retained;
a failed cleanup remains pending for an explicit retry.

Resumption restores the original persisted conversation, synthesizes missing tool results when a
turn ended mid-call, and re-evaluates the role against the current parent mode, sandbox, deadline,
and step budget. The new result and lifecycle events carry `resumed_from=<old_run_id>`. By default,
an unreleased isolated candidate is transferred to the new run at the same worktree path, so only
the new run can later be applied or discarded. Pass `reattach_workspace=false` to start from the
role's normal workspace view instead; the old patch artifact is still named in the resume context.
Successful or degraded children can continue with a nonempty follow-up task. Each run can be continued once;
a repeated request returns `continuation_run_id` identifying the chain's next run. The original
report remains retrievable, while the new run ID owns transferred work and further follow-ups.
Active and unknown runs return structured errors. Applied, discarded, or duplicate
worktrees cannot be reattached; explicitly use `reattach_workspace=false` to retain conversation
history while starting a fresh workspace.
An incomplete result and its `subagent_end` event name the actual `stop_reason`, steps used and
resolved ceiling, deadline remaining, retained run ID, and an exact `subagent_resume(run_id=...)`
affordance when resumption is possible. Resume or steer retained work instead of rebuilding it.
Resume also carries forward content-hashed read-ledger entries that still match the attached
worktree, so unchanged ranges are not returned again; changed files are read normally.

Child continuation requires the original live parent session. Restarting or resuming a saved parent
session does not restart workers or rebuild their run-ID registry. Automatically delivered reports
are restored as bounded, untrusted historical evidence, with a reminder to check current state;
stale callable child locators are omitted. Retained worktree files survive as described below, but
their recorded locations do not recreate live apply/discard/resume handles after restart.

### Steering background children

Use `subagent_send(run_id, message)` to correct or refine queued, waiting, or running work without
restarting it. The child receives `Message from the parent agent: <text>` as a system message before
its next model call; queued and waiting children receive stored messages at their first step. The
limit is 4,000 characters. Unknown or terminal runs return structured errors, and successful sends
emit additive `subagent_message` telemetry.

### Chained background children

`subagent_spawn(..., depends_on=[run_id, ...])` leaves a child in `waiting` until every dependency
joins successfully. A failed, degraded, incomplete, or cancelled prerequisite cancels the child
with `dependency_failed`; the child never launches. Duplicate, unknown, self-referential, and cyclic
dependencies are rejected. Waiting children remain part of turn-end wait/cancel enforcement, and
their deadline eligibility is checked again when they become runnable.

The one-response candidate flow is: spawn an isolated general worker with `run_id=impl`, then spawn a
verifier with `depends_on=[impl]` and `workspace_from_run=impl`; wait for both and call
`subagent_apply(impl)` only after the verifier passes. Caller-selected IDs accept only 1-64 ASCII
letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens and must be unique in the parent session. Pinned-worktree
resolution is deferred until the writer joins and captures its candidate.

Each completed same-response parallel batch and dependency chain emits one additive
`subagent_batch_summary` event with ordered run IDs, statuses, wall time, summed usage, and workspace
views. It does not change model-facing results.

Configuration examples:

```text
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.max_background_children 3
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.turn_end_policy wait
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.parallel_nonwriting_shared false
```

### Isolated workspaces

Pass `workspace_view=isolated` to `subagent_run` when a child should work away from the parent's
working tree. Alysis Code snapshots the parent's current files into an internal Git commit and
creates a detached worktree under the session artifact directory: `subagent_worktrees/<run_id>`.
The snapshot includes tracked edits and deletions plus nonignored untracked files, without modifying
the parent's HEAD, index, or files; staging intent is not copied. Files requiring configured external
Git clean, smudge, or process filters are refused rather than executing those commands on the host
or silently substituting unfiltered content. Unused filter configuration remains supported.
Checkout checks the child's effective configuration too. Failed checkout is cleaned up; incomplete
capture retains child output for inspection. Git-ignored dependencies, local configuration,
and other setup files are excluded, so the child may need its own setup. The active parent's session
log and artifact directory are excluded too. Launch refuses detected concurrent snapshot changes.
Isolated submodules and nested repositories are currently unsupported and are refused at launch.
The child keeps its normal mode,
allow/deny write scopes, and workspace-mutation reconciliation; those policies are evaluated
inside the worktree.

The prepare event and returned `workspace` metadata identify the snapshot as `base_commit`, the
original `parent_head_commit`, and `parent_dirty_paths`.
The result contains a patch summary (files, insertions, deletions, SHA-256, and an internal artifact
locator) for only the child's net changes relative to that snapshot. The complete Git patch,
including binary patches for regular files when needed, is persisted as a session artifact and is
never placed in the model-facing tool result.

After reviewing the result, use:

- `subagent_apply(run_id)` to check and apply the captured patch to the parent working tree.
  Application is serialized, uses `git apply --check` first, and leaves successful changes
  uncommitted. A conflict applies nothing and retains the worktree for inspection. Applying a
  candidate whose run did not succeed requires `acknowledge_incomplete=true`; otherwise the tool
  returns its status, stop reason, and unfinished-work summary without changing the parent tree.
- `subagent_discard(run_id)` to delete the worktree without changing the parent.

The captured candidate must still match the child workspace at apply time. Apply and close
re-capture its files and retain material changes made since capture; apply returns
`workspace_changed_after_capture`. Continue the child to capture and assess its current work before applying.
Ignored-only additions retain their files while leaving the ordinary Git patch applicable.

Complete candidates normally remain available until applied, discarded, or the parent session closes.
Git-ignored child outputs are reported separately as `retained_ignored_paths`; they are not applied
to the parent. Their worktrees survive apply and session close until explicitly discarded, including
when the ignored outputs are only caches. Incomplete or failed captures also survive close and
cannot be applied. A child whose
complete capture establishes no changes is host-classified as `no_changes`, marked as semantic
no-progress, and released automatically. Incomplete capture retains the candidate and reports the
limitation; ignored-only output also prevents automatic no-change release. Candidates with ignored
output are not automatically deduplicated. Other materially identical results are identified from their base commit, changed paths,
and patch digest—not from task wording. The first result remains the canonical candidate; later
duplicates keep their run provenance and patch evidence but do not retain another physical
worktree after successful cleanup. If cleanup fails, the duplicate is marked `cleanup_pending` and
its worktree remains until an explicit discard or the parent session's close-time retry. Applying a
duplicate resolves through the canonical candidate exactly once, while discarding a duplicate
leaves the canonical candidate intact. Unknown and already-released actions return structured
errors. Version 1 supports Git repositories only; a plain directory returns
`workspace_view=isolated requires a git repository`. Disable the feature with:

```text
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.workspace_isolation_enabled false
```

When a depth-0 full-screen TUI turn receives a fully typed captured duplicate as its first and only
tool call, the host finishes that turn locally and durably arms one model-history rollover. At the
turn boundary it clears stale model-visible conversation, compactor memory, and read-ledger state,
then retains one allowlisted lifecycle capsule for the next request. The rendered transcript and
queued images remain visible. Classic chat, one-shot runs, and nested sessions keep their existing
history behavior, and session resume treats an armed rollover as a durable history boundary.

The provider creates private snapshot commits without advancing parent refs. Applying a result
never stages or commits the parent tree.

### Parallel writers and pinned verification

The recommended isolated implementation flow is:

1. Run or spawn a `general` writer with `workspace_view=isolated`.
2. Run or spawn a non-writing verifier with `workspace_from_run=<writer_run_id>`.
3. Continue the writer with `subagent_resume` to address findings, or discard an unwanted candidate.
   Apply the final candidate only after its verification passes.

`workspace_from_run` mounts the completed, unreleased candidate worktree as the verifier's root, so
the verifier sees the candidate while the parent tree remains unchanged. It is available to roles
whose definition disallows workspace writes, including `verifier`, `explorer`, `code-reviewer`, and
`debugger`. The source worktree is release-locked until that child finishes; apply/discard returns
`workspace_release_locked` while pinned. Unknown, unfinished, and released source IDs return
structured errors. A verifier does not create a second candidate worktree.

### Helpers inside write-capable children

Depth-1 write-capable children may consult a small non-editing helper roster without returning to
the parent between implementation steps. Built-in helpers are `explorer` for repository research,
`code-reviewer` for independent review, `verifier` for evidence-based checks, and `debugger` for
root-cause investigation. Automatically routable custom roles with
`allow_workspace_writes: false` are also eligible. Readonly children, Forge
execution, and swarm workers do not receive this tool.

The helper runs synchronously in the same root the writer sees. An isolated writer's helper reads
that writer's worktree; a shared writer's helper reads the shared root. Helper reports are advisory
and never replace the writer's own verification duty. Helpers cannot spawn, wait for, apply, or
discard children, and depth-2 sessions expose no `subagent_run`, so nesting stops absolutely there.

The default allows two helper calls per writer, without a helper-specific step or wall-clock
ceiling. A helper still inherits an active writer deadline. Calls are sequential, and an exhausted
call-count budget returns a structured `helper_budget_exhausted` result. When a deadline is active,
launch also requires enough remaining time for twice the writer's current robust per-call latency
estimate. A helper that cannot plausibly complete two model calls is refused before launch so the
writer can continue directly. Deadline-blocked child events make the terminal
`subagent_end.deadline_exhausted` summary true.
model usage first replays into the writer; the parent's normal writer replay then carries both
writer and helper records once. The writer result and `subagent_end` event summarize `count`,
`names`, `steps`, and `usage_totals` under `helper_runs`.

```text
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.helpers_enabled true
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.helper_max_total_per_child 2
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.helper_max_steps unlimited
alysis config set subagent_orchestration.helper_timeout_s unlimited
```

Numeric helper limits remain available as explicit operator policy.

Built-in subagents:

- `explorer` (read-only repository investigation with concise evidence-first findings)
- `dependency-scout` (read-only external dependency research grounded in pinned local versions and
  cited web evidence; `scout` is an alias)
- `general` (bounded research, diagnosis, implementation, refactoring, or mixed work within inherited permissions)
- `frontend-engineer` (optional web UI specialist with responsive, interaction-state, accessibility, and evidence-based visual-QA requirements; disabled by default)
- `debugger` (diagnostic reproduction and root-cause isolation without source edits)
- `verifier` (evidence-based proof that a finished candidate meets its acceptance criteria, using the repository's real checks without source edits)
- `code-reviewer` (strict read-only review with verdict + blocking/non-blocking issues)
- `visual-designer` (opt-in production raster generation with a read-plus-generate sandbox; available only when image generation is enabled)

Built-in prompt behavior:

- gives general workers a broad assignment contract and specialists distinct investigation, frontend, diagnosis, verification, review, or raster-generation contracts
- keeps `explorer` and `code-reviewer` strictly read-only
- lets `debugger` run targeted diagnostics and verification while prohibiting repository edits; a host-observed material mutation degrades the run with `unexpected_workspace_mutation`
- lets `verifier` run the repository's authoritative checks while prohibiting edits, then return an evidence-backed pass, fail, or inconclusive verdict; `debugger` finds the cause of an unexplained failure, while `verifier` proves a finished candidate
- requires `shell_run` for `debugger` and `verify_run` for `verifier`; if the requested mode or
  host capability removes a required tool, launch is refused before the child runs and reports the
  smallest sufficient mode
- lets `general` investigate without editing or make the smallest requested change allowed by the parent session; frontend quality guidance also applies to general workers
- makes `frontend-engineer` use the repository's existing frontend stack and explicitly cover responsive layout, accessibility, and loading/empty/error/disabled states
- prevents `frontend-engineer` from calling `image_generate`; raster work belongs to `visual-designer`
- prevents `frontend-engineer` from returning a generator prompt as a substitute for an image request
- limits `visual-designer` to read-only repository tools plus `image_generate`, so it cannot edit application source or existing assets
- requires `visual-designer` to generate an actual file for in-scope bitmap requests; users never need to ask it to call a function or tool
- degrades a `visual-designer` run instead of accepting success when `image_generate` is missing from its sandbox or no successful `image_generated` event proves that an artifact was written
- requires both visual specialists to distinguish technical/build validation from visual inspection and to report `Visual QA` as pending when no real browser/vision evidence was inspected
- requires concise evidence-backed handoffs instead of action transcripts
- requires agents to report verification actually performed and remaining uncertainty or blockers

### Evaluation-informed working methods

For uncommitted work, `code-reviewer` starts with `git_status` and a path-scoped `git_diff`. It
reads the surrounding lines needed to interpret a hunk and the tests covering the changed
behavior through `fs_read` with `start_line`/`end_line`. It expands the read when the
review needs more context. `git_history` remains absent from this role's sandbox;
other readonly roles retain their history tool when history is part of their task.
`verifier` follows the same diff-first discovery rule before choosing authoritative checks.

Treat review and verification as separate decision points when review findings may change the
tree: review, fix, then verify. Reuse a child's evidenced verification while the tree remains
unchanged instead of running the same command again. Host-structured `verify_run` results are the
authority for pass/fail; truncated raw output can add detail but cannot contradict `all_passed`.

Direct work avoids a fresh child's context and coordination overhead for a simple assignment.
Delegate writes when independent work can run in
parallel, when a clean isolated candidate enables verify-before-apply, or when risk justifies that
isolation.

For repository-mapping tasks, `explorer` ends its report with a compact `Map:` of up to 15
`path - one-line role` entries. The parent should navigate from that handoff and use targeted
confirmation reads instead of repeating the repository walk. Truncated `fs_read`
results report returned and next ranges. A byte-clipped line remains in the next
range because its suffix has not been read; increase `max_bytes` if that line alone
exceeds the ceiling. Whole-file and window reads share the same 12,000-byte default.
Line totals are `null` until the reader observes EOF; a focused read does not scan
the remainder just to count lines. Reaching a later line still scans its prefix,
using bounded memory. Cross-turn read-ledger deduplication applies only to files
within the default byte budget; larger files remain readable and are returned
without that optional suppression.

When a managed-browser capability is attached, `verifier` also receives the approved browser
inspection surface plus `browser_start`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, and `browser_type`.
For a user-facing web change with a runnable target, it starts the app with the managed service
tools, navigates to that session-owned service's `preview_url`, performs a browser smoke of the
changed flow, records snapshots or screenshots as `Visual QA` evidence, and stops the service.
Preview authorization is recomputed from the session's active durable-service registry: it matches
scheme, host, and port exactly while allowing paths below that origin. Other loopback URLs remain
blocked. The verifier remains non-writing, browser actions keep host approval, and browser artifacts
remain session artifacts rather than repository changes.

### External dependency research

`dependency-scout` handles questions the repository cannot answer, such as version-specific
library APIs, migrations, upstream behavior, and advisories. `explorer` remains the role for local
repository questions. A scout first reads manifests and lockfiles to pin the local version, then
uses the real `web_search` or `web_fetch` tools and separates path-cited repository facts from
URL-cited external claims.

The role is callable only when web tools are enabled and web search has a configured, ready
adapter. For example, set `web_tools_enabled=true`, configure a supported search adapter, keep
`web_search_mode` enabled, and start a new session. Capability context and launch errors report the
concrete missing configuration and whether a new session is required. The exception is
definition-scoped: only a
readonly child that both requires `external_research` and allowlists the web tools receives them;
ordinary children and depth-2 helpers do not.

A scout cannot succeed on model memory alone. Its child event store must contain at least one
successful `web_search` or `web_fetch` result; otherwise the host degrades the run with
`required_capability_evidence_missing`. Its report includes the answer, pinned version context,
source URLs, confidence, and anything it could not verify.

### Image generation setup

Image generation is disabled by default because calls can incur a separate provider charge. The
`visual-designer` agent and `image_generate` tool are omitted from callable roles until enabled.
They remain discoverable through capability errors and the main agent's capability context, with
an actionable reason instead of an "unknown subagent" error.
Mode-gated sessions use the effective tool surface for that context, so a readonly session reports
the concrete mode switch required instead of advertising the visual role as callable.

Configure an OpenAI-compatible image endpoint and credential, then start a new chat session:

```powershell
$env:ALYSIS_IMAGE_API_KEY = "<image-provider-key>"
alysis config set image_generation.enabled true
alysis config set image_generation.model gpt-image-1
# Optional when the active provider profile is not the image provider:
alysis config set image_generation.base_url https://api.openai.com/v1
```

Instead of `ALYSIS_IMAGE_API_KEY`, set
`image_generation.api_key_env` to the name of a provider-specific environment variable. If neither
is configured, Alysis Code reuses the active session credential. Generation accepts PNG, JPEG, and
WebP output paths, creates one to four new files, validates decoded image dimensions and format,
and never overwrites an existing file.

Optional safety and provider limits are configurable through
`image_generation.timeout_s`, `image_generation.max_images_per_call`,
`image_generation.max_image_bytes`, and `image_generation.max_pixels`.

### Exercise a built-in through chat

Ask the main agent to delegate to a named role when testing one specialist at a time:

```text
Delegate this to frontend-engineer: implement the settings card in src/web/... using the existing design system. Cover mobile/desktop, loading/error/disabled states, keyboard access, and run the focused frontend checks. Report visual QA evidence separately.

Delegate this to visual-designer: create one transparent product illustration for the empty state. Inspect existing assets under src/web/assets first, write a new PNG under that convention, and report dimensions/hash plus visual-QA status. Do not edit source code.
```

The visual role becomes callable only in a session started after image generation was enabled.
The task itself should state only the desired creative outcome and output constraints; never
instruct the agent to call `image_generate`.

Discoverability:

- when subagents are enabled, the `subagent_run` tool schema exposes autonomously routable subagent names in `name.enum`
- enum values are built from the loaded registry, so available custom subagents with automatic routing visibility are included automatically
- the main agent also gets a pinned `<subagent_context>` message with autonomously routable and capability-gated subagents plus delegation guidance, so it can decide when to delegate or report a grounded blocker
- repo turns also get bounded, system-layer `<subagent_turn_context>` capability metadata when
  subagents are available. It is not newer user input and does not recommend delegation; the model
  follows the actual user request.
- use `--no-subagents` or `alysis config set subagents_enabled false` for a hard disable
- general phase-budget guidance may suggest implementation, focused delegation, or reporting a
  blocker after repeated exploration only when observed mutation activity authorizes execution
  pressure. Invocation mode and Permissions do not establish that the user requested mutation;
  inspection remains a valid outcome in both one-shot and interactive sessions.
- when enabled, the main system prompt also adds short delegation guidance for autonomous subagent_run use (disabled sessions keep baseline prompt behavior)

Routing visibility controls autonomous discovery, not whether a custom role remains registered:

- `routing_visibility: auto` is the default for built-in and custom roles; these roles can appear in the tool enum and parent routing context.
- No built-in currently uses `routing_visibility: manual`.
- Custom subagents can set `routing_visibility: auto` or `routing_visibility: manual` in
  frontmatter. Manual custom roles stay registered but are omitted from the autonomous enum and
  parent routing context. Unknown values normalize to `auto`.

### Enablement and specialist models

`enabled: false` disables a built-in role, including direct calls by name. This is separate from
`routing_visibility: manual`, which only hides automatic discovery. The default roles are `general`,
`explorer`, `code-reviewer`, `verifier`, and `debugger`, subject to their permissions and tool
requirements. Research and image roles still require their capabilities.

`frontend-engineer` is disabled by default. Explicit `enabled: true` or an explicit `model` for
that specialist enables it; `enabled: false` wins even when a model is set. Changing the parent's
model does not change this decision. A `model_role` fallback alone is not an explicit specialist
model. General workers retain frontend quality instructions when this specialist is off.

Built-in roles support metadata-only overrides. For example, create
`.alysis_agents/frontend-engineer.md` with:

```md
---
name: frontend-engineer
model: your-frontend-model

This keeps the built-in prompt and tool restrictions. Alternatively, use `enabled: true` with no
model to inherit the normal model selection. Set `enabled: false` to disable the role. Start a new
session after changing role files. A Markdown body still replaces the role's instructions as a
custom definition; review its tool and permission settings accordingly.

An optional `profile` selects an existing saved provider connection for that child:

```md
---
name: code-reviewer
profile: your-review-profile
model: your-review-model
---
```

The runtime clones the parent configuration, selects this profile, then resolves the explicit
`model`, `model_role`, or profile default through the normal model rules. A model ID alone never
changes providers. Omitting `profile` inherits the parent's connection. Switching profiles uses
the target's explicit endpoint, model/reasoning defaults and its own stored key or profile-scoped environment key;
parent overrides and legacy/global key fallbacks are not forwarded. Subscription profiles retain
their provider-owned authentication. Missing profiles or target credentials fail explicitly.
An unset target model needs an explicit model/role selection, and unset target reasoning does
not inherit the parent's provider-specific setting. Naming the active profile preserves the current
invocation's model and thinking settings; an explicit child `model` still takes precedence.
This applies to foreground children, background children, continuations and permitted helpers;
it does not change tool permissions or expand helper depth. Child start/end evidence identifies
the effective profile and model without recording credentials. Saved configuration is not modified.

The built-in `implementer` has been replaced by `general` without an alias. Rename built-in role
references and model override files to `general`. An existing custom definition named `implementer`
remains a custom agent and is not automatically migrated.

Custom subagents can be defined with YAML frontmatter + markdown body in:

- project: `./.alysis_agents/*.md`
- user: `~/.config/alysis/agents/*.md`

Frontmatter example:

```md
---
name: api-reviewer
description: API-focused reviewer
mode: readonly
allow_workspace_writes: false
allow_tools:
  - fs_read
  - fs_list
  - symbol_search
  - search_rg
deny_tools:
  - shell_run
# Claude-style aliases are also supported:
# tools: [fs_read, fs_list, symbol_search, search_rg]
# disallowedTools: [shell_run]
model_role: review
routing_visibility: auto
---
You are a strict API reviewer. Focus on breaking changes and missing tests.
```

Notes:

- Custom markdown bodies are treated as scoped subagent guidance, not as a full system-prompt replacement.
- Base `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is always preserved for subagent sessions.
- Built-in/code-owned subagent prompts may add trusted system-layer guidance; user-defined subagents provide scoped guidance and cannot replace the base system prompt.
- Main agent gets only the final subagent result, not intermediate nested tool outputs.
- Only eligible depth-1 writers can invoke bounded non-editing helpers; depth-2 recursion is blocked.
- Tool permissions are sandboxed by per-subagent allow/deny lists.
- Explicit `allow_tools` lists (including `tools_allow` and `tools` aliases) fail
  before a child model call if an entry is unavailable. This also applies to
  metadata-only overrides of built-in roles. Omitted lists retain the role's
  existing scope; built-in optional capabilities may narrow to the host's tools.
  Resuming a child validates its current configured list again.
- The parent catalog labels each autonomously routable role with
  `parallel_batch_eligible=yes|no`. This is scheduling metadata only: choose roles by task fit;
  batch eligibility does not determine which role to pick. Shared-view calls need exact `readonly`
  mode or the explicit non-writing opt-in described above; isolated calls are eligible in any
  post-clamp mode. Eligible calls can run as a parallel subset while remaining calls are deferred.
  The host runs at most four concurrently, preserves result order, and prevents queued children
  from launching after parent cancellation.
- Nested tool-event IDs include the per-invocation subagent run ID, so parallel calls to the same
  role cannot overwrite one another's UI/protocol state even when providers reuse child-local IDs.
- Parent cancellation reaches both synchronous model-directed batches and background child runs.
- Write-capable child runs are wrapped in a host-owned before/after workspace reconciliation.
  Snapshot-observed changes are unioned with tool-reported paths and returned as
  `touched_repo_paths`, `material_touched_repo_paths`, mutation classifications, and `effects` on
  success, failure, cancellation, incomplete, and degraded outcomes.
- Set `allow_workspace_writes: false` on a custom diagnostic role to make material workspace
  changes an `unexpected_workspace_mutation` degradation. This detects and reports a contract
  violation; it does not automatically revert the affected paths.
- The billable `image_generate` capability is exposed only when image generation is enabled.
- Each child session receives an exact model-visible catalog of the filtered
  tool names it may call, with required arguments. The catalog is built after
  permission filtering and tells the child not to invent aliases; unknown-tool
  recovery remains active inside the child session.
- Default subagent mode is `readonly` unless explicitly overridden.
- Review-mode subagents suppress nested UI chatter but forward approval prompts through the parent session surface.
- Non-interactive subagent sessions still fail fast when a nested write/shell/verify action would require confirmation.
- Ordinary subagents have no default step ceiling. They continue until their
  delegated task completes, they are cancelled or blocked, or they encounter a
  fatal error. The optional `max_steps` tool argument adds an explicit safety
  limit for that child only.
- Child repetition safeguards compare the complete sanitized tool name, arguments, and outcome.
  Identical calls whose outcomes change are legitimate re-checks and reset the consecutive count.
  Tools that embed wall-clock fields in otherwise stable outcomes, such as background-process
  snapshot or wait payloads containing `elapsed_ms`, cannot produce identical fingerprints and are
  therefore invisible to this sensor; cancellation, provider no-progress detection, and any
  explicitly configured or inherited deadline remain independent safeguards.
- The root turn separately tracks terminal subagent outcomes as structured semantic evidence.
  Volatile run IDs, timings, usage, and report prose do not make an identical material result look
  new. Repeated equivalent outcomes use the existing configurable repetition nudge/stop policy;
  there is no subagent-specific step or wall-clock cap. A real parent-visible apply/discard or a
  materially different result advances the objective state and resets the comparison.
- The root turn also indexes each accepted background launch by its typed objective. Run IDs,
  display labels, timings, and operational limits do not turn the same launch objective into new
  work. Exact replicas requested together in one assistant tool batch remain valid deliberate
  fan-out. The same normalized objective requested again in a later assistant generation is
  coalesced to the canonical run and terminates the stagnant turn, even when the new call rotates
  or omits its run ID. Profile aliases, surrounding task whitespace, default modes, and parent
  mode clamps are normalized exactly as launch preflight normalizes them; the remaining task bytes
  and substantive typed inputs stay exact. The host never guesses task equivalence from English
  keywords or a fixed phrase list.
- Ordinary subagents have no default wall-clock ceiling. An active parent deadline is inherited
  exactly, so delegation cannot extend an explicitly bounded parent run. Operators can opt into a
  child-specific ceiling with, for example, `alysis config set subagent_timeout_s 600`, or restore
  the default with `alysis config set subagent_timeout_s unlimited`.
- Child LLM and tool-call timeouts clamp against that resolved child deadline.
  Lifecycle telemetry records the optional `subagent_timeout_s`, `resolved_timeout_s`,
  `resolved_deadline_source`, and the full resolved `deadline` snapshot, including disabled
  deadlines.
- Next-call admission estimates duration from the median of the latest five completed calls rather
  than one historical maximum. Telemetry records the estimator, window, samples, and estimate. A
  call that overruns into the reserve proceeds directly to finalization; admission is still refused
  when the robust estimate cannot fit the total hard time remaining.
- If too little hard time remains, or the parent has entered the soft
  finalization window, `subagent_run` and `subagent_spawn` refuse to launch and return the usual
  error-shaped result with deadline metadata such as
  `failure_category: "deadline"`, `deadline_prevented_launch`,
  `deadline_start_decision`, and `remaining_seconds`.
- Release changes to subagent deadline propagation should follow the focused
  [release checklist](release_checklist.md).
- For precise inspection, prefer `symbol_search` for Python/JS/TS symbol navigation, `search_rg` for broader text hits, `fs_read` with line options to read the exact surrounding range, and the same reader without line options for a bounded raw head.
- For history or regression questions, prefer `git_history` over raw shell commands.
- Subagent execution mode is capped by the parent session mode (no privilege escalation): readonly < review < auto < fullaccess. Built-in definitions additionally restrict their visible tools; for example, `debugger` has diagnostic tools but no direct file-edit tools.
- Subagent token/cost usage is replayed into the parent session one child model call at a time, including failed subagent runs, so `/usage` and the chat HUD preserve call counts and api-vs-estimate attribution.

## Future directions

The remaining orchestration work is deliberately narrower: parallel scheduling for bounded
helpers, snapshot-backed isolated views for non-Git roots, opt-in auto-apply policies, and richer
merge strategies than the current conflict-checked patch application.
