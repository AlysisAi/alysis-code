# Security Model

Alysis Code is a local coding agent. The host process owns policy decisions, tool registration,
workspace binding, and session logging. Model-authored text can request tools, but host-owned
runtime checks decide which tools exist and what inputs are accepted.

## Trust Boundaries

Treat these inputs as untrusted:

- repository files and project-local configuration
- MCP server output
- web responses
- custom tool output
- image/OCR/asset text
- model responses

Alysis Code keeps those inputs behind host-owned wrappers where possible. These wrappers reduce prompt
confusion, but they are not a substitute for reviewing changes before running them.

## Execution Modes

- `readonly` exposes inspection tools only.
- `review` asks before writes and shell commands.
- `auto` can make approved changes with fewer prompts.
- `fullaccess` removes mode-level write and shell approval prompts.

The execution mode is the only approval authority. There is no second
"auto-approve" switch that can answer prompts on your behalf: if the footer badge
says `safe`, writes and shell commands stop and ask. In the TUI, Shift+Tab cycles
the mode (`read → safe → fast → full`) and `/mode` selects one directly; both
print a warning whenever the session lands in `fullaccess`.

`--yes` is scoped to `auto` mode, where it skips the file-deletion and
sensitive-command confirmations. It does not relax `review` and does not grant
Workspace Trust.

`fullaccess` is for trusted workspaces only. It is not a sandbox boundary and should not be used for
untrusted repositories, unknown prompts, or commands you would not run directly.

## Shell And Verification Sandboxing

Shell and verification commands can run through Docker or Bubblewrap. Production-style usage should
keep sandbox mode strict, network disabled unless needed, and Docker images pinned by digest.

The sandbox reduces the blast radius of local command execution. It does not make arbitrary code
safe, and it does not replace source review, dependency review, or operating-system permissions.

Verification and acceptance evidence also has a provenance boundary. Host
verification commands, explicit user checks, pre-existing repo-native tests,
pre-existing task checkers, direct black-box commands, self-authored tests, and
ad hoc observations are recorded separately. Tests or checkers created during
the same turn can help diagnose behavior, but they are supplemental when a
required acceptance criterion still lacks independent evidence or has direct
contrary evidence.

Verification commands carry a separate typed command contract. Exact shell
expressions with pipelines, redirections, or chaining are trusted only when they
come from host configuration, an explicit user command, or a pre-existing
repo/task checker; model-inferred shell chaining remains invalid even if it
looks like a test. Interpreter snippets are accepted only after language and
syntax preflight and are executed through an interpreter invocation rather than
raw `/bin/sh`. Generic pytest fallback is not security authority by itself: it
requires a trustworthy pre-existing Python test surface, and tests created
during the current turn cannot retroactively establish that surface.

Acceptance paths keep a trust boundary too. A path mentioned by a prompt is
classified with a role before it can affect finalization: required output,
existing input, preservation target, verification checker, or advisory
reference. Workspace-internal absolute paths are normalized to workspace
relative form; external absolute paths and unresolved parent traversal are not
silently joined under the workspace or probed to satisfy a heuristic. Only hard
criteria can block completion. Advisory parser inferences remain visible in
payloads but do not become security-sensitive finalization requirements.

Acceptance preservation checks compare explicit unchanged/only-touch
constraints against material touched paths after filtering runtime artifacts.
Threshold checks remain failed when measured output misses the requested
target; performance-style thresholds require repeated samples before they are
treated as conclusive.

Persistent service evidence has an additional ownership boundary. A
`shell_background` process is owned by the session and is terminated by
`AgentSession.close`, so it is not durable evidence. A `shell_service_start`
process is explicitly durable, stores only sanitized identity/readiness/log
metadata in the runtime sessions directory, detaches stdin/stdout/stderr from
the agent process, and uses PID/container identity checks before `shell_service_stop`
signals anything.

See [Shell sandbox](shell_sandbox.md) for setup, image pinning, signatures, provenance, and troubleshooting.

## HTTP And SSRF Protection

Alysis Code validates outbound HTTP targets used by web fetch/search helpers and MCP OAuth metadata
fetching before connecting.

The safe HTTP guard rejects:

- unsupported schemes such as `file:`, `data:`, `ftp:`, and `javascript:`
- embedded URL credentials
- loopback, link-local, private, unspecified, and multicast IP ranges
- hostnames that resolve to denied IP ranges
- redirect targets that fail the same validation
- responses larger than the configured byte cap

Where supported, requests connect to a validated resolved address while preserving the original
`Host` header, and redirects are revalidated at each hop.

`web_fetch` has a separate provenance gate before the safe HTTP request is
started. A fetchable URL must come from the user, from a configured
`web_search` result, from an observed canonical redirect, or from a bounded
same-origin/search-mediated recovery path. URLs discovered inside trusted
fetched pages, trusted local file reads, and registered tool or shell output are
kept as bounded source-linked provenance records; source content is not persisted
in the provenance graph. Canonicalization may ignore fragments, default ports,
and harmless trailing slashes, but it does not relax scheme, credential, DNS/IP,
redirect, or byte-cap validation. Recovery search is not attempted during
deadline finalization.

Unknown-tool recovery is also deliberately narrow. The runtime reports available
tool names and nearest suggestions, but does not expose hidden schema details,
environment data, credentials, or plugin implementation metadata. Only
hard-coded schema-compatible compatibility aliases can execute automatically;
ambiguous names produce correction guidance instead.

## MCP Boundaries

Project-local MCP configuration can only narrow or disable exposure relative to user configuration.
Tool, resource, and prompt catalogs are snapshotted per session rather than mutated live in the
model-visible tool surface.

Server-authored MCP tool descriptions are intentionally omitted from model-visible descriptions.
MCP resource text is wrapped as untrusted content and size-limited before prompt inclusion. Task
execution can further restrict MCP access through task-level scope rules.

## Skills, Plugins, Hooks, And Custom Tools

Skills are instruction bundles. They are advertised briefly and read on demand; their text is still
untrusted repo or user content.

Plugins and custom tools require explicit install/trust flows. Project custom tools are trusted by
workspace path and file hash, so edits invalidate trust. Custom tool execution runs in a worker
process with declared capability checks, but it is still trusted code and should be reviewed before
use.

Lifecycle hooks are deterministic policy and automation. Project hook configuration is not trusted
by default and must be explicitly trusted. Hook output can modify prompts or tool inputs, so review
hook configs before trusting them.
