"""Capture a failed task's work before its workspace is cleaned up.

Swarm failure cleanup removes the task worktree and branch so the next run is not
blocked by leftover state. That is correct housekeeping and wrong data handling: the
worktree is the only place some of the work exists. An uncommitted edit, or a new
file the worker never got to commit, disappeared with the directory.

So every cleanup path first calls :func:`preserve_failed_task_evidence`, which
writes the task's full diff (committed *and* uncommitted, plus untracked file
contents) and its verification log into ``<run>/execution/evidence/<task>/``. That
directory lives in the run, not in the worktree, so cleanup can then proceed exactly
as configured.

Capture is best effort by construction: it must never raise, never mutate the
workspace it is reading (no ``git add``, no index writes), and never be the reason a
cleanup is skipped. Whatever it could not capture is recorded in ``errors`` and in
``evidence.json`` rather than silently dropped.
