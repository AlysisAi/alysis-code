"""Non-fakeable build identity: which commit is actually running.

Three behaviourally different builds once all reported themselves as version
``0.9.8``, and one benchmark campaign turned out to have run against an
unpinned "latest main". Every score those runs produced is therefore
unattributable: there is no way, now, to say which source tree earned which
number. A version string is a promise the developer makes; a commit hash
recorded at build time is a fact about the artifact.

This module owns three things:

*The generated fact.* ``scripts/generate_build_info.py`` writes
``_build_info.py`` next to this file, stamping the commit, an ISO-8601 UTC
build timestamp, and whether the working tree carried uncommitted changes. The
copy committed to the repository is a deliberate *dev default* -- no commit,
marked dirty -- so that an artifact built without running the generator is
correctly reported as unidentifiable rather than quietly inheriting a stale
hash.

*The reading.* :func:`load_build_info` tolerates the file being absent,
truncated or hand-edited, because the failure mode that matters is a build
that cannot prove its identity, and that must surface as a clear refusal
rather than an import error.

*The refusal.* :func:`decide_clean_build` is the policy behind
``--require-clean-build`` / ``ALYSIS_REQUIRE_CLEAN_BUILD``. Benchmark
harnesses set it so a campaign cannot start against a build whose provenance
is unknown -- the precise mistake that cost the earlier campaign its meaning.

Stdlib only, no package imports: the generator script runs this in a bare
interpreter before the package is installable, and the tests load it straight
from this file path.
