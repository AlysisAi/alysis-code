"""Dispatch timing policy: cancellable waits, promotion thresholds, overhead.

This module is deliberately dependency-light -- standard library only, and no
imports from the rest of the package -- for the same two reasons as
``budget_policy``:

* it is loaded by ``agent/tools_assembly.py`` on the shell dispatch hot path
  and must not drag anything in;
* it holds the decision logic that has to be unit-testable in a bare
  interpreter, without executing ``alysis_code/__init__`` (which pulls
  in httpx/pydantic/rich). ``tests/test_dispatch_timing.py`` loads this file
  directly by path.

What went wrong in production
----------------------------
Terminal-Bench telemetry showed ``tool_dispatch`` averaging 30.4s over 72
dispatches on ``compile-compcert`` -- 2,190s of a 3,484s run -- with the
maximum pinned at 60.08s. That bucket is not generic dispatch overhead:
``_deadline_operation_for_tool_name`` special-cases only ``shell_run`` and
``shell_background``, so **``shell_wait`` falls through into
``tool_dispatch``**. The 60.08s ceiling is ``shell_wait``'s own cap
(``min(wait_seconds, 60.0)``, schema ``maximum: 60``).

Two defects follow from that, and this module addresses both:

1. **A wait in flight could not be preempted.** The terminal manager waits on a
   ``threading.Condition`` that knows nothing about the run budget, so PR2's
   watchdog -- which sets a ``threading.Event`` -- could not interrupt a wait
   already running. A 60s wait armed just before the deadline outlived it.
   :func:`run_cancellable_wait` fixes this by driving the *existing*
   completion-driven wait in short slices and re-reading the cancellation token
   between them, so a budget stop is observed within one slice instead of at
   the end of the full wait. The wait stays completion-driven: each slice
   returns the instant the process emits output or exits, so nothing is made
   slower, and no busy-spinning is introduced.

2. **Dispatch overhead was unmeasurable.** ``shell_tool`` timed the whole
   dispatch, including the workspace walks that mutation detection performs
   before and after every command, so the cost of the machinery could not be
   separated from the cost of the command.
   :class:`DispatchOverheadAccount` does that subtraction, and the result is
   reported under :data:`DISPATCH_OVERHEAD_OPERATION` as its own
   ``duration_observations`` category.

Environment lookups go through :data:`os.environ` rather than
``branding.env_get`` to keep this module free of package imports; ``env_get``
is itself just ``os.environ.get``, so the behaviour is identical.
