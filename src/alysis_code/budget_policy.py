"""Run-budget policy: sizing, stop-reason, watchdog, and progress checkpoint.

This module is deliberately dependency-light -- standard library only, and no
imports from the rest of the package. Two reasons:

* it is loaded by ``agent/turn/core.py`` and ``agent/session.py`` on the hot
  path, and must not drag anything in;
* it holds the decision logic that has to be unit-testable in a bare
  interpreter, without executing ``alysis_code/__init__`` (which pulls
  in httpx/pydantic/rich). ``tests/test_budget_policy.py`` loads this file
  directly by path.

Environment lookups stay local rather than importing ``branding`` for the same
reason. The prefix-derived ``SYLLIPTOR_*`` fallback is repeated in the small
lookup helper so standalone and package execution keep the same behavior.

Why a watchdog exists at all
----------------------------
Every pre-existing budget check in the engine is a *start gate*: it is
evaluated before an operation begins (``ExecutionDeadline.start_decision``,
``deadline_timeout_or_raise``). Nothing re-checks the clock while an operation
is in flight, so any blocking call that does not bound itself by the deadline
can outlive the budget indefinitely -- which is exactly what was observed in
production, where runs recorded ``exhausted: true`` and then kept going for
hours. :class:`BudgetWatchdog` is the stop gate: a daemon timer armed once at
run start that trips a cancellation event at ``budget + grace``, regardless of
what the main thread is blocked on.
