"""Sampling determinism controls and provider-response provenance.

Two production incidents motivate this module, and both were *unprovable* after
the fact rather than merely unfixed.

*Silent model drift.* Three Terminal-Bench trials of one pinned build under one
pinned config disagreed on 30 of 89 tasks. Two SWE-bench runs of a
byte-identical build scored 80 and then 71 four days apart, with the delegation
pattern changing beyond recognition (one subagent went from 128 invocations to
zero). Server-side drift was the obvious suspect and stayed a suspicion,
because nothing in the run recorded which model actually answered. The response
``model`` field, the ``system_fingerprint`` and a small set of routing headers
are the only evidence a client can collect without the provider's cooperation,
so this module selects them and hands them to provider telemetry.

*Unpinned sampling.* The client pinned no seed, requested no ``top_p``, and let
``temperature`` follow whichever code path built the request, so two runs of one
build were free to sample differently from an identical prompt. The three
settings here are opt-in precisely because switching them on changes the wire
request: when none is configured the payload is left exactly as the transport
built it. :func:`apply_sampling_to_payload` guarantees that by construction --
it is the single place any of the three fields can enter a payload -- and
``tests/test_sampling_config.py`` asserts it byte-for-byte.

Stdlib only, no package imports: the transport, the telemetry recorder and the
session bootstrap all pull this in, and the tests load it straight from this
file path in a bare interpreter.

Redaction boundary
------------------
This module *shapes* values, it never persists them. Every caller writes
through a sink that funnels its serialized line through
``logging_redaction.redact_log_text`` immediately before the write
(``SessionStore.append`` and ``provider_telemetry._append_to_sink``), and
``provider_telemetry`` redacts each selected header value a second time before
it reaches the in-memory history. Independently of redaction, the header
allowlist here is bounded by a deny list that no user-supplied allowlist can
widen, so a credential-bearing header cannot be selected in the first place.
