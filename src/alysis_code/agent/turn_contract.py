"""Turn-contract v2: apply-don't-advise + spec-literalism enforcement (step 4).

This is the pure, side-effect-free core of turn-contract v2. It builds on the
same machinery as steps 1-3: the acceptance-contract derivation records concrete
*expectations* from the task text (semantic understanding), and the completion
gate enforces them **mechanically** — fact matching only, never NL heuristics.

Two problems this step targets (evidence: SWE-bench Verified subsets 1-5):

* "described the fix, didn't apply it" — an execute-intent turn ends in prose
  with zero edits. The gate refuses to finalize such a turn silently; it demands
  a recorded ``advisory_completion`` disposition (reason + explanation) that is
  surfaced in the final summary.
* "alternative-mechanism fixes that contradict text the agent read" — the task
  names an expected output literal, a faulty locus, or a behavioral contract, and
  the agent ships something else. Each such *expectation* must reach an explicit
  disposition (confirmed / superseded / not_applicable) at finalization, else the
  turn finalizes honestly with an ``UNCONFIRMED EXPECTATIONS`` marker.

Design invariants (identical in spirit to steps 1-3):

* Semantic extraction of expectations is done in the contract-derivation step
  (see ``acceptance_contract.extract_task_expectations``); this module never
  applies NL/keyword heuristics to user or assistant text. The only text matching
  here is a *contract-literal substring lookup against observed command output*.
* Every function is pure and unit-testable without an LLM call.
* Dispositions and the advisory-completion reason are enum-validated. In this
  release production populates them mechanically (an ``expected_output`` literal
  observed in a post-edit run, or a named ``locus`` that was edited, confirms the
  expectation; a zero-edit execute finalization synthesizes an advisory reason).
  ``superseded`` / ``not_applicable`` remain first-class enum members so a future
  agent-provided disposition channel can populate them without touching the gate.
