"""Reproduction-first protocol for bug-fix-shaped tasks (verification step 5).

The failure this targets is a *plausible patch that misses the reported symptom*:
the agent fixes its interpretation of the bug, verifies that interpretation, and
finalizes believing it is done. Nothing in steps 1-4 catches it, because every
signal the agent produced (edits, passing tests, confirmed expectations) is about
the agent's own reading of the task.

The protocol adds one fact the agent cannot manufacture from its interpretation:

1. before touching product code, derive a minimal reproduction of the *reported*
   symptom and run it;
2. it must FAIL on the unpatched tree. A repro that passes pre-fix is evidence the
   interpretation is wrong -- revise the repro (bounded rounds), do not start
   editing;
3. after patching, the same repro must pass;
4. the summary states the repro status either way -- never silent success;
5. repro scaffolding never reaches the delivered diff.

Design invariants (identical in spirit to steps 2-4):

* Every function here is pure and unit-testable without an LLM call. The single
  exception, ``surviving_repro_artifacts``, takes an explicit root and only stats
  paths (mirroring ``acceptance_contract``'s bounded filesystem probes).
* Phase classification is a *fact*, never a heuristic: a repro run is pre-fix iff
  no non-artifact repo path had been touched when it ran. Writing the repro is
  itself a material edit, so edit generation cannot discriminate -- the artifact
  set can.
* Task shape comes from the validated provider-neutral semantic router contract.
  This module maps that enum into protocol state and never interprets user
  language itself.
