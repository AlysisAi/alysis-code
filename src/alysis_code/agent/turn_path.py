"""The router-free unified turn path.

No router client is provisioned, every text turn goes straight to the main
model with the full per-mode agent surface, and execution posture derives
from the execution mode instead of a pre-turn routing call. The legacy
routed path has been removed: ``ALYSIS_UNIFIED_TURN_PATH`` and
``unified_turn_path_enabled`` remain accepted for one release but are
ignored — every turn takes the unified path.
