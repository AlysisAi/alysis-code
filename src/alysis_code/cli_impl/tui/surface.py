"""``TuiSurface`` — renders agent events into the full-screen TUI transcript.

The agent runtime drives surfaces through the legacy ``on_*`` callbacks (same
path ``RichSurface`` uses), calling them synchronously from whatever thread runs
``session.run_turn``. In the TUI that is a worker thread, so every handler just
mutates the thread-safe :class:`TuiTranscript` (which schedules a redraw); none
of them touch prompt_toolkit widgets directly.

Message/tool ``emit_*`` events are additive duplicates of the ``on_*`` calls and
are intentionally left undefined (defining no-op versions would double-render).
Error/warning/info are EITHER/OR in the runtime, so we provide real
``emit_error``/``emit_warning``/``emit_info`` handlers -- otherwise the
runtime's capability probe would drop them. Info events are persistent
transcript entries; progress updates remain ephemeral status text.
