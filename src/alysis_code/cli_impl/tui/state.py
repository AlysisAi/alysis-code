"""Mutable view-model for the full-screen TUI.

Holds only what the footer/header need to render. The footer HUD fields
(``context_pct`` / ``tokens`` / ``cost_usd``) are wired live: ``loop.py`` seeds
them when the session is built and refreshes them after each turn (and mid-turn,
throttled) from the session's usage summary + context cache. Other fields are
toggled by the user via Tab (persona) / Shift+Tab (execution mode).

``exec_mode`` mirrors ``session.mode`` and is the single authority for what the
agent is allowed to do without asking. There is deliberately no second
approval-policy flag here: an independent "auto-approve" toggle could silently
answer every gate that ``review`` mode raised, leaving the footer advertising a
guarded mode while the session behaved like ``fullaccess``.
