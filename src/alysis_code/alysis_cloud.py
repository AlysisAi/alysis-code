"""Endpoints and identifiers for the hosted Alysis Code Pro service.

`alysis login` runs an RFC 8628-style device flow against Supabase Edge
Functions (`device-code` / `device-token`); the user approves the code on the
account website's /activate page. The CLI receives a gateway key (``slk_…``)
and talks to the Alysis Code LLM gateway — an OpenAI-compatible proxy that meters
the subscription's credits server-side. The CLI never holds upstream provider
keys for Pro; BYOK profiles are configured separately and take precedence.

Values can be overridden via environment variables to point at a different
deployment (e.g. a staging project or local stubs) during testing.
