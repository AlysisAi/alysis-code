"""Tracked process-group lifecycle for agent-spawned shell commands.

A shell command that outlives its tool call keeps consuming the machine. The
observed failure mode is a timed-out test run: ``subprocess.run(timeout=...)``
kills the direct child (the shell) and returns, but the shell's *children* --
the pytest workers -- are never signalled and keep running. On a shared or
benchmarked host they then compete with whatever runs next.

The fix is ownership, not discovery. Every command the runner starts is placed
in its own POSIX process group (``start_new_session``), and the resulting pgid
is recorded here at spawn time. Reaping later signals *only* those recorded
pgids.

Hard safety rule, enforced structurally by this module:

* ``ProcessGroupRegistry`` can only learn a pgid through :meth:`register`,
  which the runner calls with the pgid of a process it just created.
* Nothing here ever enumerates the process table, and nothing ever matches a
  process by name, cmdline, or any other heuristic. There is no code path that
  can signal a group the runner did not spawn.
* A recorded pgid is refused if it is not a positive integer, if it is this
  process's own group (a defensive check for a host where session creation
  silently failed), or if the group leader's start token changed since
  registration. That last guard reads ``/proc``, so it is active on Linux and
  absent on macOS/BSD; there the residual exposure is a pgid recycled in the
  window between a tool call returning and the group being released, which is
  the same window ``release_if_finished`` closes on the very next statement.

The reaping guarantee is scoped to the session that did the spawning: a session
never signals another session's groups, and an interactive session's own turn
never kills groups that session started. A nested delegation (subagent or
worker) still cleans up what *it* started when it ends -- its work is over,
and the groups belong to it.

Everything except the signalling helpers is pure and unit-testable without
spawning a process. The platform guard is a separate function so the tracking
and decision logic stay exercisable on any host, mirroring the PIPESTATUS
capture guard in :mod:`alysis_code.pipeline_facts`.
