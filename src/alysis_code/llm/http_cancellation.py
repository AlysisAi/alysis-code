"""Cancellation boundary for one owned synchronous HTTP request.

Native provider clients create a short-lived ``httpx.Client`` per call. Merely
closing an ``httpx.Response`` from another thread is not enough to interrupt a
blocked SSL read on every supported OS. This module therefore arms the owned
client's network backend before the request starts and shuts down its live
sockets when cancellation fires. Response/client close remain as fallbacks for
custom transports and normal httpx bookkeeping.
