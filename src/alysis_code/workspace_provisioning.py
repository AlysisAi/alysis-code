"""Pre-provisioning of a workspace's *declared* test runner.

Most autonomous sessions in a Python repo start the same way: run the tests,
watch them fail with ``No module named pytest``, install pytest, run them
again. The gap is knowable before the first command -- the repo declares its
runner in a config file -- so discovering it by failing a test run is pure
waste, repeated once per session.

This module closes exactly that gap and nothing wider:

* Detection is **config-file evidence only**. A repo declares pytest in
  ``pytest.ini``, ``pyproject.toml`` (``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``),
  ``tox.ini`` (``[pytest]``), or ``setup.cfg`` (``[tool:pytest]``). Source
  trees are never scanned, and the presence of ``tests/`` or a ``test_*.py``
  file is *not* evidence -- those say tests exist, not which runner the repo
  declared.
* The only package that can ever be installed is the declared runner, and only
  when it is not importable. An importable runner is never upgraded or
  reinstalled, and no other package is ever touched.
* Both the "is it importable" probe and the install run **through the session's
  own shell execution path**, never through the agent's interpreter. That is the
  environment the agent's test command will actually resolve, so it is the only
  environment whose answer means anything -- and routing through it also keeps
  the operator's shell-sandbox policy (network, filesystem) binding on an action
  the agent would otherwise have taken itself. A session with the shell disabled
  provisions nothing.
* Installation happens only in a **top-level autonomous run**, is attempted
  **once** per process, and is never retried after a failure. Interactive runs
  and nested sessions (subagents and conflict resolvers) never
  install: an interactive run reports the gap and leaves the call to the agent
  or the user, and a nested run inherits whatever its parent already decided.

The decision is a pure function over facts, so the policy is testable without a
filesystem, a subprocess, or an LLM.
