# Slash commands and native chat

Slash input in the Alysis Code sidebar is routed by an extension-side command router to typed
controllers and command-palette handlers instead of being sent to the model as chat text. Unknown
slash commands fail closed with help and are not forwarded to `chat.send`.

The composer uses **Permissions** (`readonly`, `review`, `auto`) and the agent's dynamic
**Persona** picker. Chat Plan/Act mode and `/plan` are retired. Use `/persona architect` for
design work or `/forge plan <instruction>` for a Forge plan. `/permissions` opens a picker;
named and numeric choices match the CLI, except full access is intentionally unavailable in
the IDE. `/mode` and `/subagent` provide migration guidance to `/permissions` and `/subagents`.
The one-turn `/ask` command is CLI-only; `/persona ask` persists until you switch persona.
Help and autocomplete show only commands supported by the connected agent and current task.

Supported commands: `/help`, `/permissions readonly`, `/permissions review`, `/permissions auto`, `/forge plan <instruction>`, `/execute preview`, `/execute plan`, `/plans`, `/open plan [plan_id]`,
`/diffs`, `/artifacts`, `/cancel`, `/doctor`, `/config`, `/config set <key=value>`,
`/update [cached|online]`, `/usage`, `/history <query>`, `/context`, `/ctx`, `/compact [focus]`,
`/resume <session_id>`, `/model <model>`, `/model-info [model]`, `/subagents status|on|off`,
`/stream on|off`, `/cd <path>`, `/pwd`, `/status`, `/clear`, `/image [path]`,
`/paste-image [path]`, `/images`, `/clear-images`, `/skills`, `/skill <name>`, `/tools`, `/hooks`,
`/mcp`, `/assets`, `/asset list`, `/asset show <asset_id>`, `/asset add <path>`,
`/asset delete <asset_id>`, `/asset edit <asset_id>`, `/asset refresh <asset_id>`,
`/asset cancel-pending`, `/asset check`, `/asset prune`, `/forge show [plan_id]`,
`/forge plan show [plan_id]`, `/profiles`, `/profile <name>`, `/profile use <name>`, `/forge plan state`,
`/forge plan validate`, `/forge plan regenerate [focus|instruction]`, `/assistant [show|text]`, `/goal [show|text]`,
`/task <task_id> ...`, `/trace`, `/trace events`, `/trace full`, `/terminals`, `/terminals list`,
`/terminals show <id>`, `/terminals kill <id>`, `/terminals clear <id>`, `/report [feedback]`, and
`/feedback [feedback]`.

Bare `/execute`, `/forge exec`, and `/forge execute` route only to Forge Execute Review; broad
execute arguments return an IDE v1 warning.

Slash commands never auto-approve actions. They do not bypass Workspace Trust, executable-origin
checks, SecretStorage forwarding guards, Preview blockers, or the cooperative active-cancellation
boundary.

## Autocomplete

Slash autocomplete appears when `/` starts the input. Up/down moves selection, Tab or Right Arrow
accepts the highlighted suggestion, Enter submits complete commands or commands with arguments,
Enter completes partial argument-taking commands such as `/pla`, Escape closes suggestions, and
Shift+Enter preserves newlines.

## Lifecycle visibility

Slash command lifecycle is visible in the Timeline. The sidebar records command start, route,
progress, warning, and error events before the command handler finishes, so `/forge plan <instruction>`
cannot fail only as a toast or Output-panel line. `/forge plan` shows validation, executable-origin,
bridge start/reuse, planning start, and planning completion/failure stages. Unknown commands remain
local and render help instead of reaching `chat.send`.

## Native VS Code chat

VS Code 1.90 includes the stable Chat Participant API used by the optional `@alysis`
integration. The Alysis Code sidebar remains the primary conversation. Native chat is a narrow entry
point for users who expect Copilot-style participant commands:

| Native command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `@alysis /help` | Opens Alysis Code and explains supported native commands. |
| `@alysis /forge plan <task>` | Opens Alysis Code and routes to Forge Plan. |
| `@alysis /execute` | Opens Alysis Code and routes to Forge Execute Review, starting with Preview and explicit confirmation. |
| `@alysis /doctor` | Opens Alysis Code and routes to Alysis Code doctor. |

Plain `@alysis` chat opens the sidebar instead of sending text directly to a model. Unknown
native slash commands fail closed with help. The participant obeys the same Workspace Trust,
executable-origin, CLI compatibility, SecretStorage, Preview, and approval boundaries as the
extension controllers, and it never auto-approves actions or parses terminal output.
